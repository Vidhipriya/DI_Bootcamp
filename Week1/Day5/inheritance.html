				Have you ever been criticised for being lazy by your loving parents but they themselves oddly seem to share that trait....yes inheritance. Children tags inherit the properties and values of their parents when it is not specified. When it is specified individually, it is similar to breaking that much needed lazy cycle.
			</p>

			<p>
				<h4>Combinator selectors</h4>
				They work in regards to inheritance. Let's take the example of <br><h5>
				div p {} </h5><br>
				The space observed between tags in this combinator selector is like the generation gaps between you and your ancestors but your eyes are still a beautiful brown because like p you have inherited the characterics of your ancestor. The example illustrated above is called the descendant selector. 
				Next up we will investigate the example  of  <br><h5>
					article > p {} </h5><br>
					The greater than symbol(>) can be seen as parents introducing their children to others and them saying proudly "yes this is my child right here" while pointing at them. And you guessed it right ,this combinator selector is called a child selector.
					Another illustration that is as interesting is<br><h5>
					h1 + p {} </h5><br>
					The addition symbol is used for adjacent sibling selectors in the same way it's always a plus to have them around and help with the chores...but also in your life ofcourse.


				</p>

				<p>
					As we have seen previously, pseudo-class selectors bring out a specific state of a tag. We can see that in terms of how sometimes genes can skip generations ony to be applied to someone.<br>
