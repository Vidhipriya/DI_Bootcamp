	   Every content within your webpage is in a box so the question has to be asked ; why is it called the box model and not the circle model or heart model. The answer is quite simple actually...for the sake of simplicity.A box takes the shape of a quadrilateral which only requires four straight lines to be drawn. This understood ,the box model is an embodiment of most technological devices available today.

	    To understand the box model, think of it as ordering a TV from overseas and it being shipped to you. The tv is protected with polystyrene in the same way the content of a box is protected with padding.The outside of the box comprises of the border and the margin seperates the box(both tv and content box) from other similar boxes .
